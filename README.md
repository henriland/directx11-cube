# directx11-cube
A rotating DirectX 11 cube with an ambient lightning.

I made an upgrade from the DirectX 11 Rastertek tutorial "Tutorial 9: Ambient Lighting" to work without the need of the obsolete DirectX 11 SDK.

Tested on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2017. 

Works with the 32-bit and the 64-bit Visual Studio build.
