# DirectX 11 Cube
A rotating DirectX 11 cube with an ambient lightning.

I made an upgrade from the DirectX 11 Rastertek tutorial "Tutorial 9: Ambient Lighting" to work without the need of the obsolete DirectX 11 SDK.

Tested on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2017. 

Works with the 32-bit and the 64-bit Visual Studio build.

<b>How to use</b>
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new Visual Studio Project and add source code to new project
3. From the project properties set characters to "Use Unicode Character Set"
4. In graphicsclass.cpp and lightshaderclass.cpp change in code "directx11-cube" to your folder name where is the source code
5. After these changes the code should work
